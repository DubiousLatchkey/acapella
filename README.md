# Fabric Example Mod

Beating Minecraft Autonomously

## What it does

Basically it uses a stack machine to push tasks to Baritone and our own functions that do all the tasks required to beat minecraft.  Currently, there is code for all of the tasks with 3 that have not been completed: fighting the dragon, pathing to the stronghold, and entering the end portal.

## Releases

Once we figure it out.

## Build it yourself
