# Fabric Example Mod

Beating Minecraft Autonomously

## What it does

Basically it uses a stack machine to push tasks to Baritone and our own functions that do all the tasks required to beat minecraft.  Currently, there is code for all of the tasks with 3 that have not been completed: fighting the dragon, pathing to the stronghold, and entering the end portal.

## Setup

For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.
